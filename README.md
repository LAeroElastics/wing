# wing
By this tiny python code, you can calculate the pressure distribution on the surface of the airfoil.

Although it is very hard to verify its performance or accuracy, you should not apply this code to flow above M=0.3 
because vortex panel method is implemented.

Please NEVER USE this tiny tiny code to design human life related equipments. YOU SHOULD NOT.
